<h2>SMS/MMS MO Postbacks</h2>
<div id="page-content"><strong>Brief Overview:</strong>
This document will provide a technical description of the SMS/MMS MO postback API. Briefly, this API allows those with an SMS/MMS MO-enabled shortcode to forward received messages (SMS/MMS MO) to their server.

<strong>SMS/MMS MO-Specific URL:</strong>
A separate Postback URL specifically for SMS/MMS MO's(Mobile Originated) may be be set via the API Settings tab of your account.  If it is not set, all postbacks will be sent to the Postback URL that is set.

<strong>SMS MO General Information:</strong>
To receive SMS MO postback notifications you need to have that option enabled in your account. Once the SMS MO 
postback is enabled you will start receiving postbacks to the URL of your choice for each SMS MO received related to 
your account.

<strong>MMS MO General Information</strong>
To receive MMS MO postback notification you need to have that option enabled in your account and you need to 
configure it within the particular MMS MO campaign.  Once the MMS MO postback is enabled you will start receiving 
postbacks to the URL of your choice for each MMS MO received on the MMS MO Keyword. If you have opted to enable
the MMS MO moderation panel, then the postback notifictions will only be sent upon manual approval of the moderator.
